                        A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics. The word is derived from
                        the ancient Greek term "gymnasium".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres,
                        and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for
                        "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or describe
                        adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" (or pl: gymnasia") often describe
                        places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and
                        with equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many
                        European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school
                        that prepares students for higher education at a university, with or without the presence of
                        athletic courts, fields, or equipment.
